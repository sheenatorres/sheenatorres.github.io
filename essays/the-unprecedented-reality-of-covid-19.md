The Covid pandemic has disrupted global human civilization. But how has it disrupted you? It can be therapeutic to spend a little bit of time reflecting on how your life has changed in the past few weeks and to think about how you might best move forward in the face of great uncertainty.

This is an extra credit assignment. It will be graded on a scale of 0 - 100 points depending upon the quality of the essay. In your essay, discuss how Covid has impacted upon your life as a college student. You can discuss anything of importance to you; here are some potential topics:

What has changed in your daily routine?
What additional family, community, or work obligations you are taking on?
How has Covid impacted your ability to learn, not just in ICS 314, but also in any of your other classes?
What new things have you learned about yourself, your family, your friends, and your community?
What changes do you think you need to make in order to move forward successfully?

It was that day when COVID-19 was declared as a pandemic according to the World Health Organization. As the virus has spread globally, a lot of major changes have been made, especially in terms on how global human civilization is now being run. As an individual, the pandemic has affected me in my school and personal life. 

One significance change that I was required to adapt to was how school is now online. After hearing the announcement that school was going to be online after Spring Break, I was kinda worried and annoyed. Since the change was so abrupt, I didn't know what to expect on how classes are going to run. From personal preference, I prefer in-person class meetings over online class. The only time I would register for an online class is if it's the only class available and it is a requirement towards my degree. Now that all classes are now online, it was something that I had to get used to. At the time I am typing this, it has only been almost two weeks since we've transferred online. I'm still not used to or liking it. There are classes that I'm having trouble with. It is upsetting that I'm not learning as much compared to what I've learned during in-person class meetings. For example, my intro to drawing course. I am in no way skilled in drawing. Without the live suggestions and critiques that my professor tells us while we're drawing, it is hard for me to judge my work and determine how to make it better at that time of moment. Now, I have to wait for his response after turning my work.

Other than the change of environment of school, there are occurred changes in my daily routine. According to the stay-at-home order that has been placed in the State, everyone is suggested to stay and work at home unless of essential services. In my case, this is something I'm very used to. If I'm being honest, I don't leave my house that much. The only difference now is that I have class in my own room, and that I don't have to wake up early and get ready to leave for school. Now that I remain in the comfort of my home, some habits of mine are settling back in. Such as, sleeping in and waking up later in the day. Then, there exists procrastination. Since I am at home instead of the dorms, I have access to a lot of things, such as video games. With all of these obstacles hurdling my school work, this is the time that I have the opportunity to strengthen my self-learning and time management. 

During this pandemic, I have learned so much about myself, family and friends, and even the community. 

In order to move forward successfully in the face of uncertainty, is to learn how to adapt with change and stick with it.
