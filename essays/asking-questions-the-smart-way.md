Being able to communicate effectively is the most important of all life skills. Having strong communication skills aids in different aspects of life, such as from our professional to personal life, and all in between. It allows others to understand us and vice versa accurately and receive answers clearly. In relative of being a software engineer, communication is one of the most important skills to develop, and by asking questions the “smart way” will help software engineers continually succeed in what they do. 

## StackOverflow
What is StackOverflow? Stack Overflow is a public question and answer site for "professional and enthusiast programmers". It features questions and answers on a wide range of topics in computer programming. In general, it allows people and programmers alike to be able to ask questions and receive answers from a wide range of people. By asking questions the 'smart way', the questions leads to both efficient and effective help. But, by asking questions the 'not smart way', the questions does not lead to effcient and effective help. There lacks communication between the person asking the question and the people trying to answer the question. It may make the question more confusing, and probably result in no answers. To help me form a deeper understanding of what constitutes 'smart' and 'not smart' questions, I have searched in StackOverflow demonstrating both and seeing how much more or less effective and efficient the answers are. 

I have searched in StackOverflow for a question submitted by a developer that demonstrates the 'smart way'.

I have searched in StackOverflow for a question submitted by a different developer that demonstrates the 'not smart way'.
