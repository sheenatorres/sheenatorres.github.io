Coding standards are a set of guidelines, and programming styles and conventions that developers adhere to when programming their source code. It is definite that by improving the quality of code based on coding standards, the efficient it is to learn a programming language. It also benefits the developer in being clean and consistent with their code.

## The Importance Of Coding Standards
Coding standards are important because they help minimize errors. The higher complexity the code is, the more vulnerable it is to have errors. By being consistent with coding standards, it'll more be easier to maintain the code. It is ideal to have a clean source when coding. From personal experience, when my code is not on par with the coding standards, the messier my code looks and the increase of vulnerability in having errors. This may cause headaches and stress on myself when I'm trying to figure out what's wrong with my code. Adhering to the coding standards will help me be efficient, organized, and well-defined when programming.

## ESLint with IntelliJ IDEA
Developed by JetBrains, IntelliJ IDEA is an integrated development environment (IDE) which allows people to develop computer software. Every aspect of this IDE is designed to maximize developer productivity. In my software engineering class, we use ESLint as our guidelines of coding standards for JavaScript. ESLint is a static analysis tool for identifying problematic patterns found in JavaScript code. Its purpose is to maintain our code quality with ease. 

In class, I was able to experience in following coding standards using ESLint in IntelliJ. With every error and warning shown to me, it was easy to fix the problems that was occurring in my code. I was consistent and was able to maintain my code whenever I would go back to it to include more information or to fix it. Also, it helps other programmers to view my code. For example, the TA (teacher assistant). As they are reviewing and grading my code on assignments, it is much easier for them to inspect and read the code. By abiding to the coding standards, it allows my code to be eligible and easier to understand.

Overall, learning about coding standards helps me be a better developer/programmer and as a student, especially in my software engineering class. Coding standards benefits me of being consistent in programming as it increases the quality of my code. As a result, my source code will look well-defined and maintained.
